FGMotionize
===========

This is just a really cheap and quick example usage of UIKit's `UIInterpolatingMotionEffect`.

## How the hell do I use this shit?
Really easy: 
* `#import FGMotionize.m` into wherever you want to use it
* make sure you also link to `<UIKit.h>`, it's always there, but I don't want to be around when it isn't
* Pass one of your views as the argument to `FGMotionize` and finally
* Get yourself a coffee, because you just created **Magic**!

## Licensed?
Dude, this is like ⌘C + ⌘V from StackOverflow. Do whatever you want with it and [tweet](http://twitter.com/fga) me if you like it.
